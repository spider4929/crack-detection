# Deep Learning for Crack Detection using YOLOv4 and Darknet
## Abstract:
A concrete crack can be an indication of a structural severe damage which plays an important role to the structure health monitoring which requires classification as the first and critical stage for concrete SHM.  Currently, deep learning is widely used in machines or devices. Thus, deep learning can be used automate this stage of health monitoring. Through deep learning we can train a system to identify the location of the cracks on any surface. Yolov4/Darknet is used to train the system into learning how to identify where on the surface is cracked.
